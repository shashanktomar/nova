# Refine Command

## Usage

`/refine [optional: scope]`

## Context

- Scope (optional): $ARGUMENTS
- If no scope provided, will ask user to specify what code to refine

## Your Role

You are the Refine Coordinator orchestrating specialized refinement agents to improve code quality.

## Process

### Step 1: Load Project Context

**BEFORE doing anything else**, invoke the `/prime` command to load all project documentation:

```
/prime
```

Wait for this to complete before proceeding. This ensures all agents have proper context.

### Step 2: Discover Available Refinement Agents

**Dynamically discover agents tagged with "refine":**

1. Use Glob to find all agent files:
   ```
   pattern: "*.md"
   path: ".claude/agents"
   ```

2. Read each agent file and parse the YAML frontmatter to extract:
   - `name`: The agent identifier
   - `description`: What the agent does
   - `tags`: Array of tags

3. Filter agents where `tags` includes `refine`

4. Build a list of available refinement agents with their names and descriptions

### Step 3: Identify Refinement Scope

If the user provided a scope in $ARGUMENTS, use that. Otherwise, ask:

"What code would you like to refine? You can specify:
- A specific file or directory (e.g., `src/nova/marketplace`)
- A module name (e.g., `marketplace`)
- A feature area (e.g., "CLI commands")
- "everything" or "all" for full codebase analysis"

Wait for their response and capture the scope.

### Step 4: Present Refinement Options

Display the discovered refinement agents dynamically:

```
ðŸ“‹ Available Refinement Agents:

[For each discovered agent with index starting at 1:]
[index]. [agent-name]
   [agent-description]

[last-index + 1]. all
   Run all refinement agents in parallel
   (Comprehensive analysis of all quality dimensions)

Which refinement would you like to perform? (Enter 1-[last-index + 1])
```

Format the description by wrapping long lines and using bullet points where appropriate for readability.

### Step 5: Capture User Selection

Wait for the user to enter their choice.

Validate the input:
- Must be a number between 1 and (number of agents + 1)
- If invalid, ask again

Confirm the selection:
- If single agent: "Running **[agent-name]** on **[scope]**..."
- If all: "Running **all refinement agents in parallel** on **[scope]**..."

### Step 6: Execute Selected Refinement

Based on user selection, invoke the appropriate agent(s) using the Task tool:

#### For Single Agent Selection:

```
Invoke Task tool with:
- subagent_type: "[agent-name]"
- description: "[Agent-name] analysis"
- prompt: "Analyze the following code with your expertise: [scope]

Please provide your specialized analysis focusing on what you do best.

Target scope: [scope]"
```

#### For "All" Selection:

**IMPORTANT: Run all discovered refinement agents IN PARALLEL using a single message with multiple Task tool calls.**

For each agent with "refine" tag, invoke Task tool with:
- subagent_type: "[agent-name]"
- description: "[Agent-name] analysis"
- prompt: "Analyze the following code with your expertise: [scope]

Please provide your specialized analysis focusing on what you do best.

Target scope: [scope]"

All agents will run simultaneously and return their results independently.

### Step 7: Consolidate Agent Findings

After the agent(s) complete, provide a consolidated summary:

#### For Single Agent:
```
âœ… Refinement Analysis Complete

Agent: [agent-name]
Scope: [scope]

Key Findings:
- [High-level summary point 1]
- [High-level summary point 2]
- [High-level summary point 3]

The detailed report from the agent is shown above.
```

#### For All Agents (Parallel Execution):
```
âœ… Comprehensive Refinement Analysis Complete

Agents Run (in parallel):
[List each agent with bullet point]

Scope: [scope]

ðŸ“Š Consolidated Findings:

[For each agent:]
**[Agent Name]:**
- [Key finding 1]
- [Key finding 2]

All detailed reports are shown above. Review the findings and let me know what you'd like to address.
```

### Step 8: Offer Next Steps

Ask the user what they'd like to do next:

"Would you like me to:
1. **Fix high-priority issues** identified by the agents?
2. **Run another refinement** on a different area?
3. **Create an action plan** consolidating all findings?
4. **Generate a detailed report** for documentation?
5. **Do nothing** - just reviewing the findings?"

Wait for their response and proceed accordingly.

## Important Guidelines

### Dynamic Agent Discovery

- **Always discover agents dynamically** - Never hardcode agent names
- **Parse frontmatter correctly** - Extract name, description, and tags
- **Filter by "refine" tag** - Only show agents tagged for refinement
- **Handle missing agents gracefully** - If no agents found, inform user

### Agent Orchestration

- **Always run `/prime` first** - This is non-negotiable
- **Present options clearly** - Use numbered list with descriptions from agent metadata
- **Validate user input** - Ensure they select valid option number
- **Run agents in parallel when possible** - Especially for "all" option
- **Capture scope explicitly** - Don't assume, ask if unclear

### Parallel Execution for "All" Option

- **Single message, multiple Task calls** - Invoke all agents in one go
- **Let them run independently** - Don't wait between agents
- **Consolidate findings** - Synthesize results from all agents at the end
- **Maximum efficiency** - Parallel execution saves time

### Output Management

- **Let agents speak** - Don't filter their output excessively
- **Summarize key points** - Provide concise high-level takeaways
- **Consolidated view** - For "all", combine findings from all agents
- **Actionable next steps** - Always offer clear options for what to do next
- **Never provide effort estimates** - Do not include time estimates, effort assessments, or complexity ratings

### Error Handling

- If no agents found with "refine" tag, inform user and exit gracefully
- If agent discovery fails, report the error clearly
- If an agent fails during execution, note the failure and continue with others
- Always summarize what was completed successfully

## Success Criteria

A successful refinement session should:
1. âœ… Load project context via `/prime`
2. âœ… Dynamically discover refinement agents from .claude/agents/
3. âœ… Clearly present discovered options to user
4. âœ… Execute selected agent(s) with proper scope (in parallel for "all")
5. âœ… Surface key findings to the user
6. âœ… Provide consolidated summary for multiple agents
7. âœ… Offer actionable next steps
8. âœ… Maintain a clear, organized conversation flow

Remember: Your role is coordination and clarity. Dynamically discover the agents, let them do their expert analysis in parallel when possible, and focus on orchestrating a smooth, user-friendly experience.
