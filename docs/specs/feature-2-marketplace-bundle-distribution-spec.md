# Feature 2: Marketplace & Bundle Distribution - Technical Specification

**Status:** ðŸš§ Draft (Interactive Design Session)
**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21

## Overview

This specification defines the technical implementation for Nova's marketplace and bundle distribution system, enabling discovery, installation, and publishing of Nova bundles through manifest-based marketplaces.

### Goals

- Enable marketplace source management (add, remove, list, show)
- Support multiple marketplace sources (public + private/org)
- Support git-based and local marketplace distribution
- Clone and cache marketplace repositories locally
- Use YAML for Nova config files, JSON for marketplace manifests

### Non-Goals

- Bundle discovery/search (next feature)
- Bundle installation/management (next feature)
- Building a centralized registry service (decentralized, manifest-based only)
- Bundle dependency resolution (future feature)
- Bundle publishing workflows (future feature)
- Bundle versioning and version pinning (future feature)

### Design Philosophy

- **Inspired by Claude Code**: Follow Claude's plugin marketplace patterns with Nova naming/structure
- **Manifest-based**: Marketplaces are static JSON files, not services
- **Git-centric**: Bundles distributed via git repos or local paths
- **Minimal and complete**: Simplest API that solves the problem
- **File formats**: YAML for Nova config files (config.yaml), JSON for marketplace/bundle manifests

## Design Decisions (Captured During Interactive Session)

### Decision 1: Marketplace & Bundle Structure
**Date:** 2025-10-21

Following Claude Code's pattern with Nova-specific naming:
- **Marketplace** = JSON file (`marketplace.json`) listing available bundles
- **Bundle** = Directory with `.nova/bundle.json` manifest
- **Nova config files** = YAML (config.yaml) for user-facing configuration
- **Marketplace/Bundle manifests** = JSON for consistency with Claude Code

**Rationale:**
- Proven pattern from Claude Code uses JSON for plugin/marketplace manifests
- YAML reserved for Nova's own config files only
- Clear separation between user config (YAML) and manifest data (JSON)

---

### Decision 2: Marketplace Configuration Scopes
**Date:** 2025-10-21

Marketplace sources configured in **global and project config only** (not user scope):
- Global config (`~/.config/nova/config.yaml`): User-wide marketplaces
- Project config (`.nova/config.yaml`): Project-specific marketplaces
- Lists **merge** across scopes (all marketplaces available)

**Config schema (YAML for Nova config files):**
```yaml
# global config (~/.config/nova/config.yaml)
marketplaces:
  - name: "official"              # From marketplace.json
    source:
      type: github
      repo: nova-team/bundles
  - name: "public-registry"
    source:
      type: url
      url: https://nova-bundles.com/marketplace.json

# project config (.nova/config.yaml)
marketplaces:
  - name: "company-internal"
    source:
      type: git
      url: https://git.acme.com/nova/marketplace
  - name: "local-dev"
    source:
      type: local
      path: ./marketplaces/dev

# Effective: lists merged, all marketplaces available
```

**How marketplace names are determined:**
1. User runs: `nova marketplace add owner/repo`
2. System fetches `marketplace.json` from source
3. Reads `name` field from marketplace.json
4. Stores entry with that name in config list
5. If name conflicts with existing marketplace, error

**Source types:**
- `github`: GitHub repository (owner/repo format)
- `git`: Generic git repository URL
- `local`: Local filesystem path
- ~~`url`: Direct URL to marketplace.json file~~ (Future extension)

**Rationale:**
- Global: Personal marketplace preferences
- Project: Team/org distribution (committed to git)
- User scope excluded: Marketplaces are discoverable resources, not personal overrides

---

### Decision 3: Marketplace Schema
**Date:** 2025-10-21

Minimal marketplace.json schema (JSON format):
```json
{
  "name": "marketplace-name",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Owner Name"
  },
  "bundles": [
    {
      "name": "bundle-name",
      "source": "./bundles/bundle-name",
      "description": "Brief description"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key points:**
- Version stored in bundle's `.nova/bundle.json`, NOT marketplace listing
- Keep marketplace minimal; additional metadata in bundle manifest
- Can extend with tags/categories later

**Rationale:** Start minimal, add fields as needed; JSON matches Claude Code's marketplace format

---

### Decision 4: Marketplace Source Types
**Date:** 2025-10-21

Support git-based and local source types:
```bash
nova marketplace add owner/repo                      # GitHub shorthand
nova marketplace add https://git.url/repo            # Git URL
nova marketplace add ./local-path                    # Local directory
```

**Future extension:** Direct URL sources (`https://url/marketplace.json`)

For git sources, assume `marketplace.json` is at repo root.

**Rationale:** Maximum flexibility for public, private, and development workflows

---

### Decision 5: Marketplace Identification
**Date:** 2025-10-21

Use **source as primary unique identifier**, with name as friendly reference:

**Primary ID:** The source itself (inherently unique)
- `owner/repo`
- `https://git.url/repo`
- `./local-path`
- `https://url/marketplace.json`

**Display name:** The `name` field from marketplace.json (for user convenience)

**Removal semantics:**
```bash
# If name is unique across all configured marketplaces:
nova marketplace remove my-marketplace

# If name conflict exists, use source for precision:
nova marketplace remove owner/repo
nova marketplace remove https://git.url/repo
```

**Rationale:**
- Source is already guaranteed unique (URLs, paths, GitHub repos)
- No need for user-provided aliases or generated IDs
- Name provides convenience for common case (unique names)
- Source provides precision when disambiguation needed
- Store both source and name when adding marketplace

---

### Decision 6: Marketplace Storage Structure
**Date:** 2025-10-23 (Updated)

**Directory structure follows XDG Base Directory standard:**

```
~/.config/nova/                    ~/.local/share/nova/              .nova/
â”œâ”€â”€ config.yaml (YAML)             â””â”€â”€ marketplaces/                 â””â”€â”€ config.yaml (YAML)
                                       â”œâ”€â”€ data.json
                                       â”œâ”€â”€ official/
                                       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ marketplace.json
                                       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bundles/
                                       â”‚       â””â”€â”€ coding-python/
                                       â”‚           â””â”€â”€ .nova/
                                       â”‚               â””â”€â”€ bundle.json
                                       â””â”€â”€ company-internal/
                                           â”œâ”€â”€ marketplace.json
                                           â””â”€â”€ bundles/
```

**Key principles:**
- **Configuration and data are separated** following XDG standard
  - Config: `~/.config/nova/` (XDG_CONFIG_HOME)
  - Data: `~/.local/share/nova/` (XDG_DATA_HOME)
- **ALL marketplace clones live in global data directory** (`~/.local/share/nova/marketplaces/`)
- **Project config references global marketplaces** - no project-specific data directory
- **Bundles ONLY exist inside marketplaces** - no separate `bundles/` directory
- **Bundle "installation"** = adding reference in config, not copying files

**Workflow:**
1. `nova marketplace add owner/repo --scope global` â†’ Clone to `~/.local/share/nova/marketplaces/<name>/`
2. Marketplace metadata stored in `~/.local/share/nova/marketplaces/data.json`
3. Marketplace config entry added to `~/.config/nova/config.yaml`
4. `nova marketplace add owner/repo --scope project` â†’ Clone to `~/.local/share/nova/marketplaces/<name>/`
5. Marketplace config entry added to `.nova/config.yaml`

**Config vs Data separation:**
- **config.yaml**: User-facing configuration (committable to git, can be in dotfiles)
- **data.json**: Internal app state (NOT committable, local cache)

**Marketplace metadata file (internal state):**
```json
// ~/.local/share/nova/marketplaces/data.json
{
  "official": {
    "source": {
      "type": "github",
      "repo": "nova-team/bundles"
    },
    "installLocation": "/Users/user/.local/share/nova/marketplaces/official",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-10-21T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Follows XDG Base Directory standard (like kubectl, helm, gh CLI)
- Clear separation: config (committable) vs data (local state)
- Users can manage config in dotfiles without including data
- No duplication: marketplace clones are shared globally
- Project config is committable, data is always local

---

### Decision 7: File Format Separation
**Date:** 2025-10-21

**Clear separation between Nova config and marketplace/bundle manifests:**

- **Nova config files**: YAML format (`config.yaml`)
  - User-facing configuration
  - Configures which marketplaces and bundles to use
  - Follows Feature 1 config system patterns

- **Marketplace manifests**: JSON format (`marketplace.json`)
  - Defines marketplace metadata and bundle listings
  - Follows Claude Code's marketplace.json format
  - Located at repo root for git sources

- **Bundle manifests**: JSON format (`.nova/bundle.json`)
  - Defines bundle metadata
  - Follows Claude Code's plugin.json format
  - Located in bundle's `.nova/` directory

**Rationale:**
- Consistency with Claude Code (uses JSON for plugin/marketplace manifests)
- Clear separation: YAML for user config, JSON for data/manifests
- JSON is standard for manifest/metadata files in ecosystems
- Easier programmatic parsing of manifests

---

### Decision 8: Marketplace Management Edge Cases

---

### Decision 9: Configuration Ownership and Dependencies
**Date:** 2025-10-21

The existing `nova.config` package remains the single entry point for discovering, parsing, and merging configuration across scopes. Marketplace-specific configuration is modelled in `nova.marketplace` and imported by `nova.config` when building the merged configuration.

**Rules:**

- `nova.marketplace` exposes a `MarketplaceConfig` model that describes a single marketplace entry (`name` + `source`).
- `nova.config` includes `marketplaces: list[MarketplaceConfig] = []` in the global/project/effective config models so the YAML loader produces fully-typed entries after merging scopes.
- Marketplace APIs accept configuration objects (or lists of `MarketplaceConfig`) supplied by callers and **must not** call `parse_config()` internally. This keeps dependencies one-directional and lets other applications embed the marketplace library with their own configuration pipeline.
- Future feature modules that own configuration follow the same pattern: publish config models, let `nova.config` import them, and expect callers to pass typed config objects into their APIs.

**Rationale:**

- Keeps configuration aggregation centralised while allowing feature modules to remain reusable and independent of file I/O.
- Avoids cyclic dependencies between `nova.config` and feature packages.
- Makes tests and library consumers free to construct configuration objects directly.

**Date:** 2025-10-21

**A) Marketplace updates:**
- Deferred to future feature
- No auto-update checking initially
- Manual update workflow to be designed later

**B) Marketplace removal:**
- No bundle installation in this feature, so no dependency checks needed
- Simple removal from config and cleanup of cloned directory

---

## CLI User Experience

This feature provides **marketplace management only**. Bundle discovery and installation will be in follow-up features.

### Marketplace Commands

**Add Marketplace**
```bash
nova marketplace add <source> --scope <global|project>

# Examples:
nova marketplace add anthropics/nova-bundles --scope global
nova marketplace add https://git.company.com/bundles.git --scope project
nova marketplace add ./local-marketplace --scope global
nova marketplace add https://example.com/marketplace.json --scope global
```

**Remove Marketplace**
```bash
nova marketplace remove <name-or-source> [--scope <global|project>]

# Examples:
nova marketplace remove official-nova-bundles
nova marketplace remove anthropics/nova-bundles --scope global
```

**List Marketplaces**
```bash
nova marketplace list
```

**Show Marketplace Details**
```bash
nova marketplace show <name>

# Example:
nova marketplace show official-nova-bundles
```

---

## Public API Contract

The `nova.marketplace` module exports an object-oriented API for marketplace management following the dependency injection pattern established in ADR-002.

### Module Exports

    """Marketplace source types."""
    GITHUB = "github"
    GIT = "git"
    LOCAL = "local"
    URL = "url"


class MarketplaceScope(str, Enum):
    """Marketplace configuration scope."""
    GLOBAL = "global"
    PROJECT = "project"
```

### Error Models

All error models are Pydantic BaseModel subclasses for type safety and validation.

```python
class MarketplaceNotFoundError(BaseModel):
    """Marketplace not found."""
    name_or_source: str
    message: str


class MarketplaceAddError(BaseModel):
    """Error adding marketplace (clone, fetch, or validation failed)."""
    source: str
    message: str


class MarketplaceAlreadyExistsError(BaseModel):
    """Marketplace with this name already exists."""
    name: str
    existing_source: str
    message: str


class MarketplaceInvalidManifestError(BaseModel):
    """Invalid or missing marketplace.json."""
    source: str
    message: str


# Union of all marketplace errors
type MarketplaceError = (
    MarketplaceNotFoundError
    | MarketplaceAddError
    | MarketplaceAlreadyExistsError
    | MarketplaceInvalidManifestError
)
```

### Data Models

```python
class GitHubMarketplaceSource(BaseModel):
    """GitHub marketplace source (stored in config.yaml)."""
    type: Literal["github"]
    repo: str  # Format: "owner/repo"


class GitMarketplaceSource(BaseModel):
    """Git repository marketplace source (stored in config.yaml)."""

    type: Literal["url"]
    url: str  # Direct URL to marketplace.json


# Union of all marketplace source types
type MarketplaceSource = (
    GitHubMarketplaceSource
    | GitMarketplaceSource
    | LocalMarketplaceSource
    | URLMarketplaceSource
)


class Contact(BaseModel):
    """Contact information for owner or author."""
    name: str
    email: str | None = None


class BundleEntry(BaseModel):
    """Bundle entry in marketplace manifest."""
    name: str
    description: str
    source: str  # Relative path like "./bundles/bundle-name"
    category: str | None = None

    author: Contact | None = None


class MarketplaceInfo(BaseModel):
    """Marketplace information for listing."""
    name: str
    description: str
    source: MarketplaceSource
    bundle_count: int
```

### Internal Models

These models are used internally and not exported in the public API.

```python
class MarketplaceManifest(BaseModel):
    """Marketplace manifest (from marketplace.json).

    Internal model - not exported from public API.
    """
    name: str
    version: str
    description: str
    owner: Contact
    bundles: list[BundleEntry]


class MarketplaceState(BaseModel):
    """Marketplace state (internal state in data.json).

    Tracks cloned marketplace state for internal use.
    Internal model - not exported from public API.
    """
    name: str
    source: MarketplaceSource
    install_location: Path
    last_updated: str  # ISO datetime string
```

### Marketplace Class API

```python
from nova.marketplace import MarketplaceConfigProvider

class Marketplace:
    """Marketplace management API following dependency injection pattern."""

    def __init__(self, config_provider: MarketplaceConfigProvider) -> None:
        """Initialize with a marketplace configuration provider."""
        ...

    def add(
        self,
        source: str,
        *,
        scope: MarketplaceScope,
        working_dir: Path | None = None,
    ) -> Result[MarketplaceInfo, MarketplaceError]:
        """Add a marketplace source."""
        ...

    def remove(
        self,
        name_or_source: str,
        *,
        scope: MarketplaceScope | None = None,
        working_dir: Path | None = None,
    ) -> Result[MarketplaceInfo, MarketplaceError]:
        """Remove a marketplace by name or source."""
        ...

    def list(
        self,
        *,
        working_dir: Path | None = None,
    ) -> Result[list[MarketplaceInfo], MarketplaceError]:
        """List all configured marketplaces."""
        ...

    def get(
        self,
        name: str,
        *,
        working_dir: Path | None = None,
    ) -> Result[MarketplaceInfo, MarketplaceError]:
        """Get details for a specific marketplace."""
        ...
```

### MarketplaceConfigProvider Protocol

```python
class MarketplaceConfigProvider(Protocol):
    """Protocol for providing marketplace configuration."""

    def get_marketplace_config(self) -> list[MarketplaceConfig]:
        """Get marketplace configuration from all scopes."""
        ...
```

**Usage Example:**
```python
from nova.config import FileConfigStore
from nova.marketplace import Marketplace, MarketplaceScope

# FileConfigStore implements MarketplaceConfigProvider protocol
config_store = FileConfigStore()
marketplace = Marketplace(config_store)

result = marketplace.add("anthropics/nova-bundles", scope=MarketplaceScope.GLOBAL)
```
